# This file holds the parameters for establishing the socat(1)-based
# communication link between the host and the guest for forwarding the
# control sockets of wpa_supplicant(8).  The contents should be in

# were configured.

# Explicitly tell if forwarding of control sockets is desired.

# Guest network coordinates, IP address and netmask as a single value.
# It is optional to set but less reliable as autodetection may not
# always work.  Expected format: "ip:netmask".

# Control socket mapping.  For each socket, there should be a variable
# with the `_port` suffix and the hyphens are replaced with
# underscores in the name.  The values specify the numbers of TCP
# ports to open over which the host can relay.  Without these
# settings, no sockets could be created on the host.
